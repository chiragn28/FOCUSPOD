## 1. Description of the project
FocusPod is a simple productivity app that consists of two main features:
* Pomodoro Timer 
* To do / Task List

"__What was the reason behind the development of such a application?"

I was inspired by web applications such as but not limited to: 
* [Hours](https://hours.zone/)
* [Cuckoo](https://cuckoo.team/)
* [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/)

As well as also building my skills such as: 
* U.I design 
* Web and Mobile app development

## 3. How to use the project/application
When we enter the website it asks if we need a tutorial and if we click yes then it gives us a walkthrough

This is how the website looks once you are done with the walkthrough

This is how the website looks after we expand all the options.
We can click on the button at the bottom right and add items to the todo list.
We can change backgrounds, background sounds, add times and reset the timer.
